## Why?
BatBot was created out of absolute bordem. This bot is **NOT** meant to be taken super seriously; I just made it for some funny commands and to help moderate some servers with greater flexibility.

If you have any suggestions or command ideas, please message me on Discord: Batman#0002

Any code I plan on archiving will end up in this repo. Hopefully, it encourages people to make their own bot from scratch or add to a project they may already have.

### How to use BatBot:
The first step to running BatBot is to invite it to your server. Use [this](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=740309408755744828&scope=bot) link to add the bot to any server you have permission to add it to.
